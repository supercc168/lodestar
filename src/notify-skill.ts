/**
 * Auto-install the `feishu-notify` skill into BOTH agent backends

 * (`~/.claude/skills/`) — so whichever the user drives at the terminal
 * can push to any bound group via `/notify` without manually placing
 * the skill file.
 *
 * Why daemon writes these files:
 *
 * Skills are discovered from `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and
 * `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` at startup. So the only way to
 * "ship with the daemon" without making the user run `cp` is to have
 * the daemon write the files itself.
 *
 * Idempotent: re-runs on every daemon boot, per location. If the
 * on-disk content matches what we'd write, no I/O. If different (daemon
 * upgraded with a new skill body, or the user hand-edited it), overwrite
 * with the daemon's canonical version. The user's edits are not
 * preserved by design — daemon owns this skill, version-locked.
 *
 * Reasonable opt-out: setting `LODESTAR_DISABLE_SKILL_SYNC=1` skips
 * the sync, for users who want to maintain the skill content
 * themselves.

# feishu-notify

Push a one-shot card into a Feishu (Lark) group via the local lodestar
daemon. The daemon binds each group to a project name (= group name);
once the daemon has seen at least one inbound message in that group,
\`POST /notify\` with the project name routes a card to it.

## Three card types

Choose exactly one interaction type. All three support the same markdown
\`text\` and optional local \`images\` paths for illustrated notifications.

| Type | Request fields | User controls |
|---|---|---|
| Plain notification | Omit \`buttons\`; omit \`allow_reply\` or set it to false | No buttons |
| Button selection | Supply nonempty \`buttons\`; omit \`allow_reply\` or set it to false | Only the caller-defined choice buttons |
| Custom text reply | Set \`allow_reply:true\`; omit \`buttons\` | One fixed 「回复」 button at the bottom |

Nonempty \`buttons\` and \`allow_reply:true\` cannot be combined; the
endpoint rejects that request with \`400\`. A \`callback\` URL by itself
does not add a reply button. Selection and custom-reply cards both
support push callbacks or pull results.

## Endpoint

\`POST http://127.0.0.1:${port}/notify\` (loopback only)

Body (JSON):

| field | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| \`project\` | ✅ | Feishu group name (= session name = working-directory name) |
| \`text\` | ✅ | Feishu schema-2.0 markdown — \`**bold**\`, \`\` \`code\` \`\`, \`[link](url)\`, \`<font color='red'>…</font>\` |
| \`title\` |   | Card header, defaults to \`project\` |
| \`level\` |   | \`info\` (blue, default) / \`warn\` (yellow) / \`error\` (red) |
| \`images\` |   | Array of local image paths \`["/abs/a.png"]\` — uploaded to Feishu and embedded above the text (failed uploads surface inline in red, never dropped silently) |
| \`buttons\` |   | Array of \`{id, text, type?}\` — renders one button per row (vertical stack, any count). \`id\`: \`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$\`, unique. \`text\`: ≤ 64 chars (a short phrase is fine — each button owns its full row). \`type\`: \`default\` / \`primary\` / \`danger\` (default \`default\`). |
| \`allow_reply\` |   | Boolean, default false. Selects the custom text reply type; cannot be combined with nonempty \`buttons\`. Only this type has a fixed 「回复」 button at the bottom. Clicking sends a separate 「等待用户输入」 card; the clicker's next text in that group is returned to the caller. |
| \`callback\` |   | Optional loopback HTTP URL (e.g. \`http://127.0.0.1:9999/hook\`) — **push mode**: the daemon POSTs the button choice or submitted text here. Must be \`http://\` on \`127.0.0.1\` / \`localhost\` / \`::1\`. Omit for **pull mode** (see below). |

Response: \`200 {ok, chat_id, message_id, notify_id?}\` (notify_id returned
when buttons are present or allow_reply is true) / \`400\` bad params / \`404\` group not
bound / \`502\` Feishu API rejected.

\`GET /notify/result/<notify_id>\` — pull the verdict with no callback
server: \`{notify_id, project, message_id, resolved, unknown, button?,
response?, reply?, resolved_at?, resolved_by?}\`. \`resolved:false\` while
pending. \`unknown:true\` means delivery cannot be safely confirmed: do
not retry automatically. \`404\` on unknown notify_id.

## Usage — one-shot

\`\`\`bash
curl -fsS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:${port}/notify \\
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \\
  -d '{"project":"ops","text":"✅ deploy done","level":"info"}'
\`\`\`

For automation that needs both success and failure paths:

\`\`\`bash
my-build-script.sh \\
  && curl -fsS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:${port}/notify -H 'content-type: application/json' \\
       -d '{"project":"ops","text":"✅ build ok"}' \\
  || curl -fsS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:${port}/notify -H 'content-type: application/json' \\
       -d '{"project":"ops","level":"error","text":"❌ build FAILED"}'
\`\`\`

## Usage — interactive buttons (push)

Add \`buttons\` and pledge a loopback \`callback\` URL you listen on. When
anyone taps a button in Feishu, the daemon POSTs the choice back to
that URL; the caller acks 2xx and the card freezes on the choice.

\`\`\`bash
curl -fsS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:${port}/notify \\
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \\
  -d '{"project":"ops","text":"deploy ready — approve?",
       "buttons":[
         {"id":"approve","text":"✅ 通过","type":"primary"},
         {"id":"reject","text":"❌ 拒绝","type":"danger"}
       ],
       "callback":"http://127.0.0.1:9999/hook"}'
\`\`\`

The callback is a local POST with this body (respond \`2xx\` within ~2.5s
or the click surfaces a 回调失败 toast and stays retryable):

\`\`\`json
{
 "notify_id": "nf_...",
 "message_id": "om_...",
 "chat_id": "oc_...",
 "project": "ops",
 "button": {"id":"approve","text":"✅ 通过","type":"primary"},
 "operator": {"open_id":"ou_..."},
 "timestamp": 1700000000
}
\`\`\`

The 2xx response body is OPTIONAL, but if you return one the daemon
renders it on the final card as the caller's reply — turning the ack
into a two-way channel. Return JSON \`{"text":"…"}\` (or \`{"reply"}\` /
\`{"message"}\`) or plain text; capped at 500 chars; Feishu markdown
allowed. Empty body ⇒ just the standard "反馈已送达" marker.

\`\`\`
→ 200 {"text":"已发布 **v1.2.3** · 提交 abc123"}
\`\`\`
renders as a new line under "✅ 已选择:… · 反馈已送达".

Minimal local receiver (Python, stdlib only):

\`\`\`python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
class H(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_POST(self):
        n = int(self.headers.get("content-length","0"))
        body = self.rfile.read(n)
        print("clicked:", body.decode())   # parse JSON → act on button.id
        self.send_response(200); self.end_headers(); self.wfile.write(b"ok")
HTTPServer(("127.0.0.1", 9999), H).serve_forever()
\`\`\`

Notes (push):
- The whole loop is localhost: \`/notify\` in, callback POST out. The
  callback URL must be loopback — non-loopback is rejected with \`400\`.
- Callback must return 2xx within ~2.5s or the click surfaces a 回调失败
  marker and stays retryable.
- Card feedback is two-phase, both phases drawn via message.patch on the
  original card after a toast ACK. The click ACKs as a toast instantly
  ("⏳ 已选择:X · 推送中…"); the card then flips to \`⏳ 已选择:X · 推送中…\`
  (Phase 1) and to \`✅ … · 反馈已送达\` / \`⚠️ … · 回调失败:…\` once the push
  resolves (Phase 2). The ACK is a toast (not an inline card) because an
  inline card ACK silently swallows any follow-up card update; and the
  callback-token endpoint \`/interactive/v1/card/update\` is a legacy path
  that draws schema-2.0 cards blank. message.patch is safe here because
  it runs AFTER the ACK (the documented footgun is patch BEFORE ACK,
  which races the ACK response). A fast second click during the push is
  blocked ("处理中…"); a failed push stays retryable.

## Usage — interactive buttons (pull, no callback server)

Skip \`callback\`. The card still ships with buttons; on tap the daemon
freezes it on the choice and records the verdict. You read the result
with a plain GET — ideal for a stateless one-line curl script that has
no HTTP server.

\`\`\`bash
# 1. send the card (no callback), keep the notify_id
NID=$(curl -fsS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:${port}/notify \\
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \\
  -d '{"project":"ops","text":"approve deploy?",
       "buttons":[{"id":"yes","text":"✅"},{"id":"no","text":"❌"}]}' \\
  | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["notify_id"])')

# 2. poll until someone taps (resolved:true)
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:${port}/notify/result/$NID
# → {"notify_id":"nf_…","project":"ops","message_id":"om_…",
#    "resolved":false}
# …after a tap…
# → {"notify_id":"nf_…","project":"ops","message_id":"om_…",
#    "resolved":true,
#    "button":{"id":"yes","text":"✅","type":"default"},
#    "resolved_at":1783242381786,"resolved_by":"ou_…"}
\`\`\`

Notes:
- A second tap on an already-resolved card is idempotent (\"已处理过\"),
  so two members clicking at once records a single verdict.
- Registrations survive a daemon restart (persisted to
  \`~/.local/share/lodestar/notify-callbacks.json\`, pruned after 7 days).

## Usage — receive a text reply

Set \`allow_reply:true\` and omit \`buttons\`. Use \`callback\` for
push, or omit it and poll the same result endpoint for pull.

\`\`\`bash
# desc: 发送允许用户输入文字回复的通知
curl -fsS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:${port}/notify \\
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \\
  -d '{"project":"ops","text":"请填写下一次部署时间",
       "allow_reply":true,"callback":"http://127.0.0.1:9999/hook"}'
\`\`\`

Only this custom-reply card places 「回复」 at the bottom. Clicking it
sends a separate 「等待用户输入」 card mentioning the clicker. Their
next text message in the same group becomes the response. This new
card updates in place to show the entered text and delivery outcome;
the original notification also shows completion.

Text callback body (\`response\` replaces \`button\`):

\`\`\`json
{
  "notify_id":"nf_...",
  "message_id":"om_original_notification",
  "chat_id":"oc_...",
  "project":"ops",
  "response":{
    "type":"text",
    "text":"明天上午十点",
    "message_id":"om_user_message",
    "prompt_message_id":"om_waiting_card"
  },
  "operator":{"open_id":"ou_..."},
  "timestamp":1700000000
}
\`\`\`

In pull mode, the result contains the same \`response\`, plus
\`resolved:true\`, \`resolved_at\`, and \`resolved_by\`. While waiting,
\`reply.status\` is \`waiting\`; a failed delivery is \`failed\` with
\`reply.error\`. A callback can return the same optional acknowledgement
body described above; it is displayed on the receipt card. That body
is the script's acknowledgement, distinct from the user's response.

- Each group has one current notification reply. Clicking another
  notification's 「回复」 abandons the previous waiting reply and updates
  its card; only the newest clicker's input is accepted. Abandonment
  does not POST an answer. Repeated clicks on the current reply do not
  create duplicate waiting cards. A reply already sending cannot be switched.
- Plain text and text-only rich-text messages work. The current reply
  takes precedence even if the message quotes an older card. Attachments
  keep their normal route; group control commands retain priority.
- Text input priority is notification reply → Agent question → ordinary
  Agent input. Agent questions wait while a notification reply is pending,
  then resume after it ends. One question is answerable at a time; further
  questions queue. An input is never submitted to two destinations.
- Only the current reply's clicker can submit or cancel it. A different
  group member can select another notification's reply, replacing the
  current waiting reply. Old cancel buttons cannot affect a newer attempt.
- The waiting card includes 「取消回复」. A click alone does not POST
  anything. A completed custom-reply notification accepts one text response.
- Callback failure stays visible on the receipt; click 「回复」 on the
  original card again to start a new attempt. No automatic resend.
- Waiting input survives daemon restart within the existing 7-day
  registration retention. A restart during sending or a persistence
  failure after external success marks the outcome \`unknown\` and
  forbids automatic retry; verify delivery with the caller.

## Notes

- For free-text input, use \`allow_reply:true\` as above; do not manufacture
  a caller-defined button named "reply" or ask users to type before clicking.
- The group must have received at least one message after the daemon
  started (the daemon learns chat_id → name binding from inbound
  events). If you see \`404\` send any message in the group and retry.
- This skill is auto-installed by the lodestar daemon on every boot.
  Hand-edits will be overwritten — set
  \`LODESTAR_DISABLE_SKILL_SYNC=1\` and restart the daemon if you want
  to maintain the file yourself.
